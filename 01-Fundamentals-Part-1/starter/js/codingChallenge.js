Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
    and height in meter).
    
    Your tasks:
    
    1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
    
    2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
        versions)
        
        3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
        whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
        
        Test data:
        
        Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
        m tall.
        
        Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
        m tall.
        
        GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
